## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyse and predict the housing market in Taipei for NotGPT. The data was explored, cleaned and analysed through Linear Regression to predict house prices according to independent variables. With these results we aim to price houses at market value.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplot, Seaborn

## Project Description
On the data_prep folder, the file 01explore.ipynb is responsible for exploring visually the data that was provided through an inside data set collect by the NotGPT client. After looking at the data we could see correlations between home prices, distance to convinience stores, the age of the houses and the distance to public transportation. After cleaning the data set, Linear Regression was used to predict prices at the 03linreg.ipynb file. 

The Linear Regrssion with the clean data had a scored set closer to 1 demonstrating less errors. The lower MSE also demonstrates a good match of the data set for the Linear Regression but there is still some room for improvement which can be achieved by more accurate and clean data or through exploring other modules of analysis for the data analysis.
